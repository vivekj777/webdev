<img src="ASH.jpg" id="img" alt=""> 
<p id="para">The incredible beauty of Kerala, Ashtamudi lake has eight branches that coincide with the Arabian sea after converging into one channel, hence the name Ashtamudi, where Ashta means eight and mudi means branch.

    Spell-binding the travelers with its inarticulate and persuasive charm, this second largest lake in Kerala is one of the most popular places to visit in Kollam. Beautifying the banks of this lake, palm and coconut trees, intensifies the fascinating experience of calm and lush green waterways.

     <p id="para">Climb up the 200 steps to enjoy the panoramic view of the Arabian sea and Kollam. Mounting grandly above the coconut trees, Tangasseri Lighthouse is the second tallest lighthouse with a height of 140 feet on the coast of Kerala.

        The red and white painted bands around the lighthouse make it marvelous and dignified. Moreover, witnessing the pleasant sunset from the top of the lighthouse is a breathtaking experience.
