<h2>FORT KOCHI</h2>
<img src="fk.webp" id="img" alt=""> 
<p id="para">A small fishing hamlet later converted to the first European township in India, today features amongst tourist places in Kochi due to the vibrancy of this place. The temperature is more or less pleasant round the year except for summer making it ideal to explore the place in a motorcycle to navigate the deepest history and beauty of this place.   

    The Fort Kochi beach looks divine during sunset offering various hues of vermilion and scarlet let. The old houses of this place have been built by British traders, thus the Dutch cottages, split farms all reminisce of an era bygone. Fort Kochi can easily be planned for two days to delve deep into the place with numerous options for stay suiting every pocket.

<img src="aaa.webp" id="img" alt=""> 
<p id="para">This beach drawing several tourists is located in a coastal village, located 4km of Pattanakkad. The tall lighthouse in white and red grabs attention as it helps navigate the seamen at night. The Andhakaranazhi Beach happens to be a site for frequent shooting for Malayalam films, thus drawing more attention from the locals.

    Though seriously affected by the Tsunami in 2004, a brand new bridge and an aerial walkway have been constructed to the sea wall for a magnificent view of a dramatic sunset to cherish for a lifetime.
