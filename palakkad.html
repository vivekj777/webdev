    Wildlife enthusiasts and thrill seekers will find it perfect to spend a day among the plethora of flora and fauna of the sanctuary along with the large population of royal Bengal tigers housed here. Set against the backdrop of Anaimalai Hills and Nelliampathy Hills, the sanctuary is a heaven for nature lovers.

<img src="p.jpg" id="img" alt=""> 
<p id="para">One of the most historically important Palakkad tourist places is the Palakkad fort or Tipuâ€™s fort. Spend a day celebrating picnic in the sprawling green grounds of the fort with your family and enjoy looking at the various statues in the complex.

    Or go for a morning or evening jog on the running track running along the moat surrounding the fort. History aficionados can spend a few hours enjoying the museum located within the grounds admiring the renovation of the fort by Archaeological Survey of India.

  <h2>MALAMBUZHA GARDEN</h2>
<img src="t.webp" id="img" alt=""> 
<p id="para">The beautifully designed gardens of Malampuzha are one of the most attractive Palakkad tourist places. Lush green lawns that are paired with well laid out flower beds full of vibrant and bright colours, the abundance of majestic fountains and artistically designed sculptures make for an idyllic escape from city life.

    The pollution fee environs will make it impossible for you to leave the place. The gardens also feature gorgeous swimming pools where you can go for a leisurely swim. The canal that runs through the centre of the gardens lends a surreal quality to the place.<br><br><br>
