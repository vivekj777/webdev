<h2>VAGAMON</h2>
<img src="VAGA.jpg" id="img" alt=""> 
<p id="para">One of the most stunning destinations out of all the Kumarakom tourist places, is Vagamon. This hill station tucked 1100 metres above sea level is all that a traveller looks for after hectic days in a city bereft of fresh air. This hill station is a chain of mesmerizing hillocks, beautiful valleys, bountiful tea gardens and cascading water.

    The skyline offers different hues of green as far as visible to our eyes. The luscious green has the prowess to revitalize, rejuvenate and reawaken the tired body and soul. Trekking is a very common sight amongst the visitors here to scout the place and unleash mother nature.
